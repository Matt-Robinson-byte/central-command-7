# central-command-7
Group Project
This project is a beer brewery webpage. It is composed of html, css, and javascript. We utilized data from a weather api, a brewery api and a city picture api to create our webpage to display a set number of local breweries based on the user input of the city in which you are searching. We also display the local weather conditions and temperature of the seached city, along with a reconmendation of the type of beer to try based on the local weather conditions. This project was designed and created by the central command 7 group which is made up of Matt Robinson, Will Burke, Andres Santana, and Brian Summerset.
